Python based shell inspired by bash and coreutils for micro python on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Heavily inspired by the bash shell and gnu coreutils.

## Why did I make this?

Well, I keep seeing videos and discussions online as to how the Raspberry Pi Pico has more ram than old computers.

I've always liked the idea that the Raspberry Pi Pico could be used as a computer, so I decided to make that a reality with these scripts.

I know it may not be custom firmware, or really low-level, but the project is more based on using the script to interact with the pico in new ways.

## How does it work?

Connect over USB to the micropython shell, and the prompt will start up.

Only some coreutils and shell built-ins work.

More documentation is coming soon.
